Title: Simple Server
Author: Fu W.W. Howard
GitHub: https://github.com/fujaidesu
Date: 12 May 2023
Code version: 1.5

Description:
Python3 file for Server receiving data from Client.
It keeps looping without closing server as default.
It can perform deserialisation if the data is deserialised.
It can perform decryption if the data is encrypted.
It has configurable option to print received data to screen
and or to save received data to file.
The format of file to be saved can be one of the following:
txt, pickle, JSON and XML.

Modification(s):
1. Input main function variables from config file.
2. Delete close file procedures.
3. Delete redundant enable_printing and enable_file.
4. save2File function enables input of file name instead of file format.
5. Add error handling in save2File.
6. receivefromClient function enables input of file name instead of file format.
7. Add printing for easy flow catching.
